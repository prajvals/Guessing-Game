# Guessing-Game

## Introduction 

This is a small guessing game I have built, I have tried to make it appear scarry for the fun of it, and that is a part that needs some more work still 
For now all basic functionalities have been implemented, I will expand on this game and make it more interesting 

## Description

1. We create a random number in the range of 1 to 20.
2. With that random number we compare the number we recieve from the input textfeild 
3. We compare and tell if its lesser or greater than that number
4. And maintain a score, losing one point for each wrong attempt
5. The score is more like life, when life goes below 20, the game ends 
6. we are maintaining the heighest scorer
7. when we press the button, the game is reset, but the heighest score is preserved
8. A little cheat code has been inserted into it, the random number is consoled outsite lol

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open HTML file in a browser / use LiveServer just as I did.
